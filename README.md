# T20_WorldCup_Analysis

This project analyzes data from the T20 Cricket World Cup 2022, scraped from ESPNcricinfo, to predict the World Playing XI. 

Data was collected via web scraping using a combination of Excel and Python.

Then cleaned and processed using Pandas and Power Query.  

The analysis involved defining specific criteria for different player roles (openers, middle-order batsmen, finishers, all-rounders, and fast bowlers) based on factors like batting average, strike rate, boundary percentage, bowling economy, and dot ball percentage. 

These criteria were applied to the cleaned dataset to identify the top-performing players who meet the requirements for each role, ultimately leading to the selection of a predicted World Playing XI.  

The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from data collection and cleaning to analysis and prediction.
